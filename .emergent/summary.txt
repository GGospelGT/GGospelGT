The AI engineer successfully progressed the  application from foundational features to significant enhancements. Initially, the focus was on critical bug fixes in the  related to uninitialized variables and  access, which were diligently debugged and resolved across multiple iterations. A notable issue was the misinterpretation of authentication status, which clarified the need for robust testing with actual logged-in users.

Following bug fixes, the engineer implemented several major features: a My Interests page for tradespeople with comprehensive job interest management and payment integration, a Browse Tradespeople page for homeowners, and dedicated Tradesperson Profile pages. A significant challenge during this phase was troubleshooting backend API 404s, which was ultimately traced to FastAPI's trailing slash requirement for specific routes, a critical architectural detail. Finally, a full Admin Job Management system (CRUD) was integrated into the . The current task involves integrating real-time SMS (Termii) and Email (SendGrid) notifications, with API keys already provided by the user. The overall trajectory demonstrates a strong iterative development approach, addressing bugs, expanding features, and resolving complex technical issues.

The  platform aims to connect Nigerian homeowners with tradespeople, offering features like user authentication, multi-step job posting, tradesperson portfolios, a lead generation marketplace, and a rating/review system, all supported by a coin-based wallet, referral system, and Google Maps.

The previous AI engineer has delivered significant features:
1.  **Admin Dashboard**: Manages locations (states, LGAs, towns), trade categories, site policies (with version control), and business contact details.
2.  **Tradesperson Lifecycle**: A 6-step registration flow including ID verification and a trade-specific skills test (requiring 80% pass rate). Admins can manage skills test questions.
3.  **Job Posting Enhancements**: Streamlined 4-step process for logged-in homeowners with auto-population of details.
4.  **Tradesperson My Interests Page**: Allows tradespeople to view and manage jobs they've expressed interest in, including payment for contact access.
5.  **Homeowner Browse Tradespeople Page**: Enables homeowners to discover tradespeople with search and filter options.
6.  **Tradesperson Profile Pages**: Detailed profiles for homeowners to view portfolios and reviews of tradespeople.
7.  **Homeowner Interested Tradespeople Page**: Homeowners can view tradespeople who have shown interest in their specific job postings.
8.  **Admin Job Management**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for jobs via the Admin Dashboard.
9.  **Real-time Notifications**: Upcoming feature to integrate SendGrid for email and Termii for SMS for various platform alerts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a comprehensive notification system, encompassing both SMS and Email alerts, to replace the existing mock notifications. The user explicitly requested to implement all types of notifications (job application, contact sharing, payment confirmation, account verification, general) using Nigerian-based services if possible, confirming both SMS and Email for all of the above notification types, and yes for Nigerian-based services.

The AI engineer successfully gathered the necessary integration playbooks for SendGrid (Email) and Termii (SMS) using the  tool. Following this, the engineer requested the required API keys from the user. The user has since provided the , , , and . The current work involves setting up the notification infrastructure using these provided credentials.

The AI engineer's work within this trajectory demonstrates an iterative, problem-solving approach, primarily focused on fixing critical bugs and enhancing existing features. Initially, the engineer tackled a frontend authentication issue where the app connected to a production backend, causing local user login failures. This involved modifying  files (despite system prompt warnings, after consulting a troubleshooter) and persistent service restarts. Upon resolving this, a new wave of user-reported issues arose: persistent login failures (due to corrupted password hashes and then network/CORS issues for mobile users), Invalid Host header errors, and missing data displays. The engineer systematically debugged these by adding detailed logging, inspecting API responses, and creating temporary login helper pages. Key efforts included implementing a tradesperson reviews section, debugging Unknown Location in homepage reviews (tracing it to a backend Pydantic model filtering out data), and enhancing the homeowner's Completed Jobs tab, which also involved creating sample data and resolving a compilation error. The latest task involves fixing the display of access fees in the tradesperson's My Interests page, identifying a backend projection and authorization issue, which has been debugged to the point where backend logs show correct data.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was debugging a critical issue where the **access fee was not displaying on the tradesperson's My Interests page**, showing ₦NaN instead of an amount.

The investigation revealed that the backend API endpoint () was returning  values for  and . This was traced back to the  function in . Initially, the projection in this MongoDB aggregation pipeline was only including a generic  instead of the specific  and  fields from the associated job.

The AI engineer applied a fix by:
1.  **Updating the projection** in  (in ) to explicitly include  and .
2.  **Adding logic** within the  function to ensure default  and  values are set if they are not present in the job data, preventing null values.
3.  **Correcting the API endpoint path** from  to the proper , which was causing a 404 error.
4.  **Obtaining a fresh authentication token** for the tradesperson () to bypass a 401 Unauthorized error during API testing.

The backend debug logs () confirmed that the backend is now correctly populating and returning the access fee values in the interests data. The immediate next step is to remove the debug logging.

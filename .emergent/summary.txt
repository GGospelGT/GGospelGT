The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the  application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform tailored for the Nigerian market. Initial work established core functionalities like authentication, job posting, a Show Interest lead system, and a robust rating/review mechanism. Significant additions included a coin-based Wallet system with admin controls and a viral Referral system with identity verification. The work then focused on integrating Google Maps for location-based job matching. Debugging included resolving a frontend authentication issue for testing. Subsequent development was heavily user-driven, encompassing the implementation of comprehensive Nigerian trade categories and specific state lists, followed by the creation of dedicated About Us, Reviews Policy, How It Works, and Partnership content pages. A brief UI feature for landing page trade categories was implemented and then reverted upon user feedback, leading to its re-implementation in the hero section. The trajectory demonstrates iterative development, direct response to user requests, and thorough testing.

The objective is to build , a responsive full-stack application for Nigeria, featuring rebranding, user authentication, multi-step job posting for homeowners, and quote/interest management for tradespeople. Core requirements included user profiles, tradesperson portfolios, a lead generation marketplace with Show Interest functionality, and a comprehensive rating/review system. Later additions encompassed a coin-based wallet system for access fees (manual bank transfer), a referral system with ID verification and rewards, and Google Maps integration for location-based job matching with tradesperson travel distances. Subsequent user requests expanded the platform with an extensive list of Nigerian trade categories, specific Nigerian states for location selection, dedicated content pages (About Us, Reviews Policy, How It Works, Partnership), and interactive dropdowns for job categories and states on the landing page's hero section. The final aim is production deployment on .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of feature enhancements driven by user requests. The Google Maps integration was successfully finished, including rendering the , visually verifying map components, and passing backend tests (96.7% success). A critical frontend authentication issue for testing was identified and resolved by creating a test user and re-verifying backend login.

Following this, the system was updated with a comprehensive list of 28 Nigerian trade categories, which involved creating a new backend model (), updating backend  models and routes for validation, and modifying frontend components like , , and . Similarly, 8 specific Nigerian states were integrated, requiring a new backend model (), updates to  (UI for location and postcode), , and state validation in backend  routes.

Several new content pages were created: , , , and . Each page was populated with detailed content, integrated into the  routing, and linked from  and . The About Us page's text formatting was refined for readability, and the Partnership page's contact details were updated to .

Most recently, the user requested an interactive dropdown for trade categories on the landing page. An initial implementation in  was performed but then reverted as it was not what the user intended. The user then clarified the request, explicitly asking for trade category and state dropdowns in the  of the landing page. This was successfully implemented, providing interactive and searchable dropdowns for job categories and states, significantly enhancing the landing page's user experience.

The current work left off with a new user request to further enhance the Post a job form with more granular location fields.

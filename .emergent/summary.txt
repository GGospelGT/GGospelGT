The AI engineer's work throughout this trajectory demonstrates an iterative approach, focusing on enhancing existing features and resolving critical bugs in the  application. Initial efforts addressed frontend authentication and data display issues. Subsequent development included implementing dynamic conditional logic for job questions in the admin dashboard, which evolved to support multiple rule types and was thoroughly debugged for frontend runtime errors. Job filtering for tradespeople based on skills and location was integrated. The job posting form underwent a transformation for a one-question-at-a-time experience, with UI design attempts and subsequent reverts, ultimately leading to usability refinements like answer validation and improved navigation. Tab-based navigation across various profile pages (tradesperson and homeowner) was consistently converted to dropdown menus for improved UX. Key bugs, such as a missing Start Chat button and  object errors, were systematically identified and fixed. The immediate task involves selectively hiding Paid Access UI elements for homeowners while preserving backend functionality.

The  platform connects Nigerian homeowners and tradespeople, offering core features like user authentication, multi-step job posting, tradesperson portfolios, a lead marketplace, and a rating system. The Admin Dashboard facilitates user and content management. Recent efforts focus on:
1.  **Dynamic Job Posting Questions**: Admin-configurable conditional logic, now supporting multiple rules per question and various question types.
2.  **Tradesperson Access Fee Display**: Correctly showing  and  on the My Interests page.
3.  **Job Filtering for Tradespeople**: Jobs visible based on tradesperson's skills and location.
4.  **Job Posting Form Usability**: One question at a time, requiring answers before proceeding, no question numbers or auto-advance, and simplified navigation.
5.  **Profile Navigation**: Conversion of tab-based navigation to dropdown menus for improved space efficiency and modern UI (Tradesperson Profile, Homeowner Jobs page).
6.  **Chat Interaction System**: Restored Start Chat button functionality for homeowners on interested tradespeople page and job cards.
7.  **Paid Access UI Visibility**: Control visibility of Paid Access elements for homeowners while keeping backend logic active.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user request to **remove the visual elements associated with Paid Access from the homeowner's interested tradespeople page**. This specifically refers to hiding the Paid Access counter card at the top of the page and the Paid Access badge displayed next to individual tradesperson profiles.

This task is a continuation of previous work where these Paid Access elements were initially removed, then re-added based on user feedback, and now the user explicitly wants them hidden again. The objective is to ensure that while the Paid Access functionality operates in the backend, its visual indicators are not presented to the homeowner.

The AI engineer has just received this explicit instruction and is preparing to modify the relevant frontend component, likely , to achieve this hiding of UI elements. This involves making precise adjustments to the JSX rendering logic to conditionally or permanently remove these specific visual components without affecting any backend-driven logic related to Paid Access.

The AI engineer systematically addressed several feature requests and critical bugs. Initially, a bug where homeowner chat displayed contact details was fixed by conditionally rendering based on user role in . Next, message delivery for both tradespeople and homeowners was verified and a perceived delivery issue was diagnosed as a React state update problem by the troubleshooting agent, though the actual fix for the state update wasn't fully detailed before a new request. The admin dashboard received significant CRUD enhancements, including new UI components and backend/frontend logic for managing various entities. Subsequently, bi-directional email/SMS notifications for messages were integrated, resolving Python import issues and missing notification templates. A job approval system was implemented, making all new jobs  by default, with admin approval/rejection features and associated notifications. Admin job editing, including setting access fees, was then added, which involved extensive modifications to  and backend APIs. A critical login failure was traced to a Pydantic deprecation in  (regex to pattern) and a misconfigured frontend backend URL, though the ultimate resolution was attributed to an external fix of a preview URL. Finally, two display bugs in the admin dashboard were resolved: Skill questions not displaying (due to a tab ID mismatch) and Job access fee section not loading (due to missing UI components and API integration). The last action was updating  after implementing job access fee management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented comprehensive job access fee management functionality within the admin dashboard. This included adding backend API endpoints, database methods, and the corresponding frontend UI components, state management, and API client methods to  and . The user reported a bug where this Job access fee section was not loading properly (Chat Message 450). The AI engineer investigated, found the content section was missing entirely, added it, and ensured its API integration. The last action in the trajectory was updating  after implementing this feature. While the frontend display was not explicitly confirmed with a *functional* screenshot (only a login page), the backend API for fetching job access fees was verified to be working correctly (Chat Message 482). The current state is that the job access fee management should be present and functional for authenticated admin users, but its visual confirmation on the frontend for an actual admin session was pending.
